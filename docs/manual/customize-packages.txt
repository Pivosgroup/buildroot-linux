Customizing packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is sometimes useful to apply 'extra' patches to packages - over and
above those provided in Buildroot. This might be used to support custom
features in a project, for example, or when working on a new architecture.

The +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ configuration file option can be
used to specify a directory containing global package patches.

For a specific version <packageversion> of a specific package <packagename>,
patches are applied as follows.

First, the default Buildroot patch set for the package is applied.

If the directory +$(BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)/<packagename>/<packageversion>+
exists, then all +*.patch+ files in the directory will be applied.

Otherwise, if the directory +$(BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)/<packagename>+
exists, then all +*.patch+ files in the directory will be applied.
