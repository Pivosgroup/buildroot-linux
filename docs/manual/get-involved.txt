Getting involved
================

Like any open source project, Buildroot has different ways to share
information in its community and outside.

One piece of it is the document you are currently reading ;-).

Each of those ways may interest you if you are looking for some help,
want to understand Buildroot or contribute to the project.

Mailing List
------------

Buildroot has a mailing list
http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot[] for discussion and
development.

[[mailing-list-subscribe]]

Subscribing to the mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subscribe by visiting
http://lists.busybox.net/mailman/listinfo/buildroot[].
Only subscribers to the Buildroot mailing list are allowed to post to
this list.

The list is also available through _Gmane_ http://gmane.org[], at
+gmane.comp.lib.uclibc.buildroot+
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.uclibc.buildroot[].

Searching the List Archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please search the mailing list archives before asking questions on the
mailing list, since there is a good chance someone else has asked the
same question before. Checking the archives is a great way to avoid
annoying everyone on the list with frequently asked questions...

IRC
---

The Buildroot IRC is irc://freenode.net/#buildroot[].
The channel +#buildroot+ is hosted on Freenode
http://webchat.freenode.net[].

When asking for help on IRC, share relevant logs or pieces of code
using a code sharing website.

[[patchwork]]
Patchwork
---------

Patchwork is a web-based patch tracking system designed to facilitate
the contribution and management of contributions to an open-source
project. Patches that have been sent to a mailing list are \'caught' by
the system, and appear on a web page. Any comments posted that
reference the patch are appended to the patch page too. For more
information on Patchwork see
http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork[].

Buildroot's Patchwork website is mainly for use by Buildroot's
maintainer to ensure patches aren't missed. The website however,
exposes patches and their corresponding review comments in a clean
and concise web interface.

The Buildroot patch management interface is available at
http://patchwork.buildroot.org[].

[[apply-patches-patchwork]]
Applying Patches from Patchwork
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main use of Buildroot's Patchwork website for a developer is for
pulling in patches into their local git repository for testing
purposes.

When browsing patches in the patchwork management interface, an +mbox+
link is provided at the top of the page. Copy this link address and
run the following commands:

---------------------
$ git checkout -b <test-branch-name>
$ wget -O - <mbox-url> | git am
---------------------

Another option for applying patches is to create a bundle. A bundle is
a set of patches that you can group together using the patchwork
interface. Once the bundle is created and the bundle is made public,
you can copy the +mbox+ link for the bundle and apply the bundle
using the above commands.

[[bugtracker]]
Bugtracker
----------

The Buildroot bugtracker is at https://bugs.busybox.net[].

To open a bug, see xref:reporting-bugs[].

Buildroot wikipage
------------------

After the Buildroot developer day on February 3, 2012,
a page dedicated to Buildroot has been created on
http://elinux.org[elinux.org].

This page is reachable at http://elinux.org/Buildroot[].

Currently, this page is mainly used as a _todo-list_.
