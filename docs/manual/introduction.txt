About Buildroot
===============

Buildroot provides a full-featured environment for cross-development.
Buildroot is able to generate a cross-compilation toolchain, a root
filesystem, a Linux kernel image and a bootloader for your target.
Buildroot can be used for any combination of these options,
independently.

Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.

Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
comes with default configurations for several boards available
off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are based on,
or develop their BSP footnote:[BSP: Board Support Package] or
SDK footnote:[SDK: Software Development Kit] on top of Buildroot.
