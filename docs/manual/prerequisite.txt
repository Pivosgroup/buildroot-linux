System requirements
-------------------

Buildroot is designed to run on Linux systems.

Buildroot needs some software to be already installed on the host
system; here are the lists of the mandatory and optional packages
(package names may vary between distributions).

Take care to _install both runtime and development data_, especially
for the libraries that may be packaged in 2 distinct packages.

Optional packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Source fetching tools:
+
In the official tree, most of the package sources are retrieved
using +wget+; a few are only available through their +git+, +mercurial+,
or +svn+ repository.
+
All other source fetching methods are implemented and may be used in a
development context (further details: refer to xref:download-infra[]).

** +git+
** +mercurial+
** +rsync+
** +scp+
** +subversion+

* Configuration interface dependencies (requires development libraries):
** +ncurses5+ to use the 'menuconfig' interface
** +qt4+ to use the 'xconfig' interface
** +glib2+, +gtk2+ and +glade2+ to use the 'gconfig' interface

* Development libraries:
