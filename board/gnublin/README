This the Buildroot support for the LPC3131 based Gnublin board (see here:
http://en.gnublin.org/) and to the Elektor Linux board
(http://www.elektor.com/news/elektor-presents-embedded-linux-made-easy.2147294.
lynkx)

Unfortunately currently the AD and the pwm modules are not supported, i'm about
to add also those drivers as well to the current kernel later.

Base kernel version: 3.7 (available here:
https://gitorious.org/linux-3-7-gnublin/linux-3-7-gnublin/commits/gnublin-
support)

U-boot version: 2009.11 (available here:
https://gitorious.org/u-boot-gnublin-support/u-boot-gnublin-support)


Steps to create a bootable SD card (with the given config you need an at least
500 MB SD card):

1.Config buildroot with the gnublin_defconfig:

$ make gnublin_defconfig

2.Tweak the config for your needs:

$ make menuconfig

3.Build:

$ make

4.Create two partitions on your SD card, one with type of BootIt (fdisk ID: df),
the size should be around 1M, and another partition with all of the left space
on the card, and with the type of normal DOS partition.

5.From the output/images directory dump the u-boot image to the BootIt partition
(probably you have to modify the output /dev files according to your system):

$ dd if=output/images/u-boot.bin of=/dev/sdc1

6.Dump the root fs image as well:

$ dd if=output/images/rootfs.ext2 of=/dev/sdc2

7.Insert the SD card into the board's slot, and your board should boot up with
your newly created system.
