#
# Config.in.legacy - support for backward compatibility
#
# When an existing Config.in symbol is removed, it should be added again in
# this file, and take appropriate action to approximate backward compatibility.
# This will make the transition for the user more convenient.
#
# When adding legacy symbols to this file, add them to the front. The oldest
# symbols will be removed again after about two years.
#
# The symbol should be copied as-is from the place where it was previously
# defined, but the help text should be removed or replaced with something that
# explains how to fix it.
#
# For bool options, the old symbol should select BR2_LEGACY, so that the user
# is informed at build-time about selected legacy options.
# If there is an equivalent (set of) new symbols, these should be select'ed by
# the old symbol for backwards compatibility.
#
# For string options, it is not possible to directly select another symbol. In
# this case, a hidden wrap bool option has to be added, that defaults to y if
# the old string is not set at its default value. The wrap symbol should select
# BR2_LEGACY.
# If the original symbol has been renamed, the new symbol should use the value
# of the old symbol as default. This requires a change outside of
# Config.in.legacy, and this should be clearly marked as such below, so that
# removal of legacy options also include the removal of these external
# references.
#
# [Example: renaming a string option from FOO to BAR]
# original symbol:
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING
#             string "Some foo string"
#
# becomes:
#     config BR2_BAR_STRING
#             string "Some bar string"
#             default BR2_FOO_STRING if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""  # legacy
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING
#             string "The foo string has been renamed"
#             help
#               <suitable help text>
#
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING_WRAP
#             bool
#             default y if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""
#             select BR2_LEGACY
#
#     # Note: BR2_FOO_STRING is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#
# [End of example]

	  The BR2_PACKAGE_QT_JAVASCRIPTCORE option was available to

	  available for all architectures, so forcing its activation
	  does not always work. Moreover, Qt knows by itself for which
	  architectures JIT support is possible, and will
	  automatically enable it if possible.

	  Therefore, this option was in fact useless, and causing
	  build problems when enabled on architectures for which the
	  JIT support was not available. It has been removed, and
