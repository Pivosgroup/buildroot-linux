	  luaposix is a POSIX binding, including curses, for Lua 5.1
	  and 5.2; Like most libraries it simply binds to C APIs on
	  the underlying system, so it won't work on a non-POSIX
	  system. However, it does try to detect the level of POSIX
	  conformance of the underlying system and bind only available
	  APIs
