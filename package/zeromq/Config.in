	  ØMQ (ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking
	  library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you
	  sockets that carry whole messages across various transports
	  like in-process, inter- process, TCP, and multicast. You can
	  connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub,
	  task distribution, and request-reply.  It's fast enough to
	  be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O
	  model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as
	  asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of
	  language APIs and runs on most operating systems.

	  ØMQ is from iMatix and is LGPL open source.
