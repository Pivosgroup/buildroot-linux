	  Babeltrace is part of the LTTng 2.x project.

	  This project provides trace read and write libraries, as
	  well as a trace converter. A plugin can be created for any
	  trace format to allow its conversion to/from another trace
	  format.

	  Having this tool on the target is not mandatory. You can
	  transfer the binary trace output from the target to your
	  development workstation, and use babeltrace here. Buildroot
	  automatically builds a host babeltrace in
	  $(O)/host/usr/bin/babeltrace as a dependency of the
	  lttng-tools package.
