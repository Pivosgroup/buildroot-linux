	  GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk and sgdisk programs) is a
	  text-mode partitioning tool that works on Globally Unique Identifier
	  (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than on the more common
	  (through 2010) Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables.

	  Install the interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
	  /usr/sbin/gdisk which is modelled after and quite similar in use
	  to the traditional MBR based fdisk tool.

	  Install the command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
	  /usr/sbin/sgdisk which is named after the traditional MBR based
	  sfdisk tool albeit with an entirely different option syntax.
