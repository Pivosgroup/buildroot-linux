	  Eio integrates with EFL (Ecore, Eina) to provide efficient
	  filesystem Input/Output (I/O). It use the best techniques to
	  achieve such purpose, like using at-variants, splice,
	  properly handling errors and doing it in an asynchronous
	  fashion by means of worker threads. It is also ported to
	  Windows, so multi-platform.

	  Whenever you need to list a directory, copy, move or delete
	  files, Eio will do that task better than you'd achieve with
	  naive implementations, and it is easy to use.
