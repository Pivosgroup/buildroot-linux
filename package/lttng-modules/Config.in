	  Kernel modules for the LTTng 2.0 kernel tracing
	  infrastructure.

	  Your kernel must have CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS enabled for this
	  package to build something useful. You may also want to have
	  CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS to access perf event counters from
	  ltt-ng. Note that system call tracing is only available on
	  architectures that support CONFIG_HAVE_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINTS.

	  The packaged version is compatible with kernel 2.6.38,
	  2.6.39, 3.0 and 3.1.0. See
	  http://lttng.org/files/bundles/20111214/README.compatible.kernels.txt
