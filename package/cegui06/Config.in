	  Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and
	  widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not
	  natively available, or severely lacking. The library is object
	  orientated, written in C++, and targeted at games developers who
	  should be spending their time creating great games, not building
	  GUI sub-systems!
