Subject: [PATCH] libXt: util: don't link makestrs with target cflags

The line:

AM_CFLAGS = $(XT_CFLAGS)

in util/Makefile.am is wrong because it adds target cflags to the
compilation of makestrs, which is built for the build machine, which
leads to build failures when cross-compiling.

We also remove the inclusion of <X11/Xos.h> from makestrs.c, because
it was the only non-standard header being included (and therefore
possibly requiring special cflags), but it was in reality not useful
at all to build makestrs.c.
