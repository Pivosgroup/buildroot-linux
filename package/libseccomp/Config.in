	  High level interface to the Linux Kernel's seccomp filter

	  The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent,
	  interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp.
	  The libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF
	  based syscall filter language and present a more conventional
	  function-call based filtering interface that should be familiar to,
	  and easily adopted by application developers.
