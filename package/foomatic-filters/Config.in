	  Foomatic Filters
	  Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free software
	  printer drivers with common spoolers under Unix. It supports CUPS,
	  LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, Solaris LP, PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct printing
	  with every free software printer driver known to us and every
	  printer known to work with these drivers.
