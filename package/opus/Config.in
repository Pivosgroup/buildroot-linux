	  The Opus codec is designed for interactive speech and audio
	  transmission over the Internet. It is designed by the IETF
	  Codec Working Group and incorporates technology from Skype's
	  SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.

	  It is intended to suit a wide range of interactive audio
	  applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing,
	  in-game chat, and even remote live music performances. It
	  can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high
	  quality stereo music.
