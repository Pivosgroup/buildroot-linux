	  The GNU `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provide a
	  framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
	  messages.

	  Only the libintl library will be installed in the
	  target. The full gettext suite, including tools, will be
	  installed in the staging directory.

	help
	  This option allows to install the complete gettext suite in
	  the target filesystem. This is typically not useful for
	  correct operation of programs.
