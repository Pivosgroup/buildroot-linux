	  The GNU `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provide a
	  framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
	  messages.

	  Only the libintl library will be installed in the
	  target. The full gettext suite, including tools, will be
	  installed in the staging directory.

	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_GETTEXT
	help
	  This option allows to install the complete gettext suite in
	  the target filesystem. This is typically not useful for
	  correct operation of programs.
