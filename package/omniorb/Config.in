	  omniORB is a robust high performance CORBA ORB for C++ and Python.
	  omniORB is largely CORBA 2.6 compliant. omniORB is one of only
	  three ORBs to have been awarded the Open Group's Open Brand for
	  CORBA. This means that omniORB has been tested and certified
	  CORBA compliant, to version 2.1 of the CORBA specification.
