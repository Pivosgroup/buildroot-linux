	  The Ne10 project has been set up to provide a set of common,
	  useful functions which have been heavily optimized for the
	  ARM Architecture and provide consistent well tested behavior
	  that can be easily incorporated into applications. C
	  interfaces to the functions are provided for both assembler
	  and NEON implementations.
