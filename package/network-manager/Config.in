	  NetworkManager is a set of co-operative tools that make networking
	  simple and straightforward. Whether WiFi, wired, 3G, or Bluetooth,
	  NetworkManager allows you to quickly move from one network to
	  another: once a network has been configured and joined once, it
	  can be detected and re-joined automatically the next time it's
	  available.
