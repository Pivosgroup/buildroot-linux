	  This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.
	  LVM supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk
	  subsystems by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. The total
	  capacity of volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which
	  are accessed as regular block devices.

	  The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM
	  (Linux Logical Volume Management) Team's implementation of a
	  minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles volume management,
	  while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout in
	  user-space. This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS,
	  software raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
