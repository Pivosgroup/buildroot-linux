	  GAIL provides accessibility support for gtk+ and
	  libgnomecanvas by implementing AtkObjects for widgets in
	  gtk+ and libgnomecanvas.

	  The GAIL library is a GTK+ module. For example, if the
	  module is loaded in a program which calls
	  gtk_widget_get_accessible() for a GtkEntry an instance of
	  GailEntry is returned. This module is normally used with the
	  atk-bridge GTK+ module from at-spi to allow an assistive
	  technology, e.g a screenreader, to query or drive the
	  program.
