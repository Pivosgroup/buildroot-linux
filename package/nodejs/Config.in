	help
	  NPM is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.
	  Note that enabling NPM on the target also selects OpenSSL for the
	  target.

	  Note that NPM is always built for the buildroot host.

	  Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application

config BR2_PACKAGE_NODEJS_MODULES_ADDITIONAL
	string "Additional modules"
	help
	  List of space-separated nodejs modules to install via npm.
	  See https://npmjs.org/ to find modules and 'npm help install'
	  for available installation methods.  For repeatable builds,
	  download and save tgz files or clone git repos for the
	  components you care about.

	  Example: serialport uglify-js@1.3.4 /my/module/mymodule.tgz git://github.com/someuser/somemodule.git#v1.2

	  This would install the serialport module (at the newest version),
	  the uglify-js module at 1.3.4, a module from a filesystem path,
	  and a module from a git repository.

config BR2_PACKAGE_NODEJS_MODULES_ADDITIONAL_DEPS
	string "Additional module dependencies"
	help
	  List of space-separated buildroot recipes which must be built before
	  your npms can be installed.  For example, if in 'Additional modules'
	  you specified 'node-curl' (see:
	  https://github.com/jiangmiao/node-curl), you could then specify
	  'libcurl' here, to ensure that buildroot builds the libcurl package,
	  and does so before building your node modules.
